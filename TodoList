Fixed the function fro calcualting change. Now need to fix toher stuff so it works and then
make executable for the qt installer.
gcc file.c -o whatevername.exe 

Can work on add item function later after done with part 3

1. maybe make struct to input everything

3. the rest
4. make pretty.

5. move functions around for makefile?
6. read me writeup

7. have time then add item function?
    derek told me to maybe consider multidimensional arrays or array or struct.
