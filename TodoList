Why is it not calculating correctly?
How come the mooney is not passing into the parameters into the fucntion?


1. maybe make struct to input everything

3. the rest
4. make pretty.

5. move functions around for makefile?
6. read me writeup

7. have time then add item function?
    might use struct for that part
